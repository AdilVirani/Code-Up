JSONJoy
=============

Convert JSON to Swift objects. The Objective-C counterpart can be found here: [JSONJoy](https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy).

Parsing JSON in Swift has be likened to a trip through Mordor, then JSONJoy would be using eagles for that trip.

Also check out this [article](http://vluxe.io/jsonjoy.html) for more information and examples.

First thing is to import the framework. See the Installation instructions on how to add the framework to your project.

```swift
//iOS
import JSONJoy
//OS X
import JSONJoyOSX
```

## Example

First here is some example JSON we have to parse.

```javascript
{
    "id" : 1,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "age": 25,
    "address": {
        "id": 1
        "street_address": "2nd Street",
        "city": "Bakersfield",
        "state": "CA",
        "postal_code": 93309
     }

}
```

We want to translate that JSON to these Swift objects:

```swift
struct Address {
    var objID: Int?
    var streetAddress: String?
    var city: String?
    var state: String?
    var postalCode: String?
    init() {

    }
}

struct User {
    var objID: Int?
    var firstName: String?
    var lastName: String?
    var age: Int?
    var address = Address()
    init() {

    }
}
```

Normally this would put us in a validation nightmare:

```
var user = User()
var error: NSError?
var response: AnyObject? = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions(), error: &error)
if let userDict = response as? NSDictionary {
    if let addressDict = userDict["address"] as? NSDictionary {
        user.address.city = addressDict["city"] as? String
        user.address.streetAddress = addressDict["street_address"] as? String
        //etc, etc
    }
    user.firstName = userDict["first_name"] as? String
    user.lastName = userDict["last_name"] as? String
    //etc, etc
}
```

JSONJoy makes this much simpler. We have our Swift objects implement the JSONJoy protocol:

```swift
struct Address : JSONJoy {
    var objID: Int?
    var streetAddress: String?
    var city: String?
    var state: String?
    var postalCode: String?
    init() {

    }
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
        objID = decoder["id"].integer
        streetAddress = decoder["street_address"].string
        city = decoder["city"].string
        state = decoder["state"].string
        postalCode = decoder["postal_code"].string
    }
}

struct User : JSONJoy {
    var objID: Int?
    var firstName: String?
    var lastName: String?
    var age: Int?
    var address: Address?
    init() {
    }
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
        objID = decoder["id"].integer
        firstName = decoder["first_name"].string
        lastName = decoder["last_name"].string
        age = decoder["age"].integer
        address = Address(decoder["address"])
    }
}
```

Then when we get the JSON back:

```swift
var user = User(JSONDecoder(data))
println("city is: \(user.address!.city!)")
//That's it! The object has all the appropriate properties mapped.
```

This also has automatic optional validation like most Swift JSON libraries.

```swift
//some randomly incorrect key. This will work fine and the property will just be nil.
firstName = decoder[5]["wrongKey"]["MoreWrong"].string
//firstName is nil, but no crashing!
```

## Array and Dictionary support

There is two ways to access Arrays and Dictionary. The first is the convenience methods.

```javascript
{
    "scopes" : ["Bakersfield", "California", "USA"]
}
```

Now for the Swift object.
```swift
struct Scopes : JSONJoy {
    var scopes: Array<String>?
    init() {
    }
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
         decoder.getArray(&scopes) //pass the optional array by reference, it will be allocated if it is not and filled
    }
}	
```

The second option is useful for embedded objects.

```javascript
{
	"addresses": [
	{
        "id": 1
        "street_address": "2nd Street",
        "city": "Bakersfield",
        "state": "CA",
        "postal_code": 93309
     },
     {
        "id": 2
        "street_address": "2nd Street",
        "city": "Dallas",
        "state": "TX",
        "postal_code": 12345
     }]
}
```

```swift
struct Addresses : JSONJoy {
    var addresses: Array<Address>?
    init() {
    }
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
		//we check if the array is valid then alloc our array and loop through it, creating the new address objects. 
		if let addrs = decoder["addresses"].array {
			addresses = Array<Address>()
			for addrDecoder in addrs {
				addresses.append(Address(addrDecoder))
			}	
		}
    }
}	
```

## SwiftHTTP

This can be combined with SwiftHTTP to make API interaction really clean and easy.

## Requirements

JSONJoy requires at least iOS 7/OSX 10.10 or above.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) 
At this time, Cocoapods support for Swift frameworks is supported in a [pre-release](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/).

To use JSONJoy in your project add the following 'Podfile' to your project

    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

    xcodeproj 'YourProjectName.xcodeproj'
    platform :ios, '8.0'

    pod 'JSONJoy-Swift', :git => "https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift.git", :tag => "0.9.1"

    target 'YourProjectNameTests' do
        pod 'JSONJoy-Swift', :git => "https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift.git", :tag => "0.9.1"
    end

Then run:

    pod install

#### Updating the Cocoapod
You can validate JSONJoy-Swift.podspec using:

    pod spec lint JSONJoy-Swift.podspec

This should be tested with a sample project before releasing it. This can be done by adding the following line to a ```Podfile```:
    
    pod 'JSONJoy-Swift', :git => 'https://github.com/username/JSONJoy-Swift.git'

Then run:
    
    pod install

If all goes well you are ready to release. First, create a tag and push:

    git tag 'version'
    git push --tags

Once the tag is available you can send the library to the Specs repo. For this you'll have to follow the instructions in [Getting Setup with Trunk](http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/getting-setup-with-trunk.html).

    pod trunk push JSONJoy-Swift.podspec

### Carthage

Check out the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) docs on how to add a install. The `JSONJoy` framework is already setup with shared schemes.

[Carthage Install](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application)

### Rogue

First see the [installation docs](https://github.com/acmacalister/Rogue) for how to install Rogue.

To install JSONJoy run the command below in the directory you created the rogue file.

```
rogue add https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift
```

Next open the `libs` folder and add the `JSONJoy.xcodeproj` to your Xcode project. Once that is complete, in your "Build Phases" add the `JSONJoy.framework` to your "Link Binary with Libraries" phase. Make sure to add the `libs` folder to your `.gitignore` file.

### Other

Simply grab the framework (either via git submodule or another package manager).

Add the `JSONJoy.xcodeproj` to your Xcode project. Once that is complete, in your "Build Phases" add the `JSONJoy.framework` to your "Link Binary with Libraries" phase.
